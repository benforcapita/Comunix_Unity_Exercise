# Comunix_Unity_Exercise

This is my Pang-style Game. 
I took inspiration from my favorite childhood game 'bubble trouble. 

Bonus Assignments :
- Architecture designed with MVC paradigm  - wasn't done. I don't think I ha
enough experience with the entity components system, although I'm using an architect that is based on 
this paradigm, I guess you wanted to use the entity system. 

- Three or more distinct consecutive levels, with increasing difficulty  - Done

- Custom visuals and shaders - I used Custom Visuals, but I didn't find a good way to demonstrate my exp
with shaders with this 2d game 

- Custom soundtracks and SFX + - Done With background sound and sound effects 

- Two-player, same-screen local multiplayer ++ -- wasn't done, mainly becouse I don't have time to continue to work on this project

- Leaderboards with player names supplied at the end of the game - Done using player's prefs
